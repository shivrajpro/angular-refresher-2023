Steps:
 1. create a file explorer module
 2. install material, uuid and add material icons CDN
 3. create FileElement model with props: id, isFolder, name and parent
 4. create file manager component with following props:
    input: fileElements[], canNavigateUp, path
    methods/events: folderAdded(name), elementRenamed(file), elementDeleted(file), elementMoved(file, moveTo)
    output: navigatedUp, navigatedDown
 5. add the context menu that contains: move to (nested menu), rename and delete
 6. add methods : add methods to open new folder dialog, rename dialog and openMenu
Till this point we have created the dumb component for file manager
 7. create a file service that contains CRUD methods: add, update, delete and read
 8. in our app component start using the file manager component with below props:
    variables: fileElements, currentRoot, path, canNavigateUp
    methods: CRUD methods which will be emitted from FM
    in our service we also need one method will update the data after each operation
    updateFileElements: which takes current path / root path as input and returns the updated data

  9. now we also need couple of methods which will push and pop folder names
     as we navigate up and down through our explorer
